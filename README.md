During my internship as an Automation Testing Intern at pearldata direct, I worked on the Digi9 project where I was responsible for designing and executing automated test scenarios using Selenium and Java.
My role involved writing and maintaining test scripts, identifying bugs, and ensuring the software met quality standards.
This experience not only sharpened my skills in test automation but also deepened my understanding of Agile methodologies and team collaboration.
